<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to use <%= vars.product_full %>
to view and delete service instances across foundations.

## <a id="login"></a> Log in to <%= vars.product_short %>

Follow the steps below to log in to <%= vars.product_short %>.

1. Open a web browser and go to
<code>https<span>:</span>//service-instance-manager.YOUR-FOUNDATION-URL</code>.

1. Log in with the email address and password you use for that foundation.

     <%= image_tag("images/cf-login-page.png", :alt => "Cloud Foundry login page, which gives two sign-in options: Cloud Foundry credentials and Google account credentials", :width => "250") %>
  * If this is the only foundation that <%= vars.product_short %> is configured to target, the <%= vars.product_short %> UI appears.
  * If <%= vars.product_short %> is configured to target any other foundations, you are redirected to the
      login page for the next foundation listed in `config.json`. Redirects continue until you have logged in
      to every foundation that <%= vars.product_short %> targets.

1. Log in to each foundation until the the <%= vars.product_short %> UI appears.

## <a id="filter-instances"></a> Filter Service Instances

You can filter service instances by a variety of properties.

* To filter by service instance name or GUID, enter a name or GUID in the search field.

    <%= image_tag("images/search-by-name.png", :alt => "Search field containing a search term. 1 of 344 search results appears below.") %>

* To filter by a category, enter the query in the search field in the format
`FILTER:VALUE`, or filter by clicking on a filter tag below the search field.<br><br>

    <%= image_tag("images/filter-by-status.png", :alt => "Status filter for errors in the search field. 2 of 344 search results are displayed below.") %>

    The available filters and their associated tags are shown in the table below.

    For example:

    ```
    foundation:Bluemonday older_than:2w6d
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>status</code>, <code>keys</code>, and <code>bindings</code>
      can only be used with the values shown in the <strong>Searching byâ€¦</strong> column.

## <a id="service-consumption"></a> View Consumption of Service Instances

The Service Consumption Dashboard provides a filtered overview of your foundations and service instances.
The dashboard is made up of summary boxes and a graph.
By default, the graph shows a summary of the bound states of instances by foundation.

To view a summary of instance consumption:

1. (Optional) To filter service instances,
    see [Filter Service Instances](#filter-instances) above. <br>
    This changes the summary boxes, which provides information about:
      + **Foundations:** This is the total number of foundations.
      + **Orgs:** This is the total number of orgs.
      + **Offerings:** This is the total number of available service offerings.
      + **Instances:** This is the total number of instances.
      + **Unbound:** This is the total number of unbound instances.
      + **Failed:** This is the total number of failed operations.

1. Select an option from the **For each** dropdown.<br>
    You can group the bars by:
    + **Foundation:** This shows the consumption of instances by foundation.
    + **Org:** This shows the consumption of instances by org.
    + **Service offering:** This shows the instances of a given service offering.
    + **Bound state:** This shows the number of bound and unbound instances.
    + **Last operation status:** This shows the number of running and errored instances.

1. Select an option from the **Show** dropdown.<br>
    You can segment the bars to show:
    + **Service offering**
    + **Bound status**
    + **Last operation status**

1. Click on a bar to apply the filters and restrict the search results to that subset of service
instances.<br>

The animated GIF below shows the **Service Consumption** summary boxes and graph. <br> <br>

## <a id="delete-instances"></a> Delete Service Instances

<%= vars.product_short %> enables you to either delete individual service instances
or delete multiple service instances based on a search or filter.
You cannot delete service instances with service bindings, service keys, or route associations.

To delete service instances:

1. Filter for service instances without service bindings, service keys.
You can filter further if necessary.
For instructions on how to use these filters others, see [Filter Service Instances](#filter-instances) above.

1. Use the checkboxes to select the instances you want to delete.

1. Click **DELETE**.

1. Click **DELETE** in the delete service instance dialog box.
  <%= image_tag("images/delete-dialog.png", :alt => "Delete Service Instance dialog box, which lists the number of foundations, organizations, spaces, and service offerings the services instances are in.") %>
